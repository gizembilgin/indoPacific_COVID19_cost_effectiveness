# 02_stochastic_outcomes_projections

## Folder contents
This folder contains code to stochastically estimate the impacts of oral antivirals and booster doses on 
severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 transmssion. For further details on parameter estimation associated with this
model see the [previous paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4456598). 

## Scripts included in this folder
