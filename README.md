**Associated paper**: Cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 booster doses and oral antivirals in the Indo-Pacific [working paper]

## Abstract
The [WHO SAGE roadmap for the use of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Roadmap) 
(updated March 2023) urges policymakers in low- and middle-income countries to re-evaluate the 
funding of COVID-19 interventions and consider the relative opportunity costs of investing in other healthcare interventions. In this paper, we used results 
from a dynamic transmission model to assess the cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 booster doses and oral antivirals in Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, 
and Timor-Leste. We explored how likely booster and oral antiviral programs are to be cost-effective, and what factors are most influential over 
their cost-effectiveness in middle-income settings.

## Code history
The underlying transmission model estimating the impact of booster doses and oral antivirals in Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste was 
developed in a [previous project](https://github.com/gizembilgin/indoPacific_COVID19_model). The results of that study have been published in [Vaccine: X](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2023.100386).
