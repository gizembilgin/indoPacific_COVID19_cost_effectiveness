**Associated paper**: Cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 booster doses and oral antivirals in the Indo-Pacific [working paper]

## Abstract
The WHO SAGE roadmap for the use of COVID-19 vaccines (updated March 2023) urges policymakers in low- and middle-income countries to reevaluate the 
funding of COVID-19 interventions by considering the relative opportunity costs of investing in other healthcare interventions. In this paper, we use results 
from a dynamic transmission model to assess the cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 booster doses and oral antivirals in Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, 
and Timor-Leste. We explore how likely booster and oral antiviral programs are to be cost-effective, and what factors are most influential over 
their cost-effectiveness in middle-income settings.

## Code history
The underlying transmission model estimating the impact of booster doses and oral antivirals in Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste was 
developed in a previous project (https://github.com/gizembilgin/indoPacific_COVID19_model). The results of that study are currently in preprint see:
