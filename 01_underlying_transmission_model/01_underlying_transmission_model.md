This folder contains the deterministic COVID-19 transmission model underlying this paper. 
Further detail on the design and execution of the model can be found in the [previous paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4284636) and Supplementary Material.

The COVID-19 transmission model used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) structure subdivided by age, vaccination status by dose and type, and risk group. 
Both vaccine- and infection-derived immunity were updated during a daily time step.
